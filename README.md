# New Design

The first scetches of a new design for the [profile page of Iris van der
Ende](https://www.irisvanderende.nl). This page still contains static content
and plain JavaScript functionality. Eventually the page will be maintained by
Iris van der Ende, using a custom created CMS. All static content will be
replaced by an API (prob. Laravel). And all plain JavaScript will be replace
with some webframework (prob. Vue).

## The story

The graphical designer, Serena Kloet, who originaly made her profile page,
wanted to create a new design for the profile page of Iris van der Ende.
Originally the page was created using a popular CMS. For a graphical designer,
this was very limiting. Being able to cowork with a developer created new
possebilities.

Iris van der Ende herself really wanted an easy to use CMS, so she didn't need
somebody helping to maintain her profile page.
